# TeamA Mission Statment

Asynchronous is committed to guiding graduate computer science students through the transition from academia to industry by providing a clear, supportive platform to build resumes, showcase professional profiles, connect with mentors, and actively pursue career opportunities.


# Purpose of the project - who is working on it and what their roles are:
+ Brendon Price - Project manager 
+ Joshua Deveau - Dev 
+ Brady Dube - Dev 
+ Alex Newman-Hancock - Design 
+ Kempton Maillett - Dev



# Communications:

Typically we ideally expect 2 hours for a discord response. At the maximum, we would like to prioritize a response by the afternoon of the next day (12:00pm). Otherwise feel free to message via phone in the created text group chat on imessage. for our @everyone policy, don't feel like you can't use it, but when you mention someone, make it a general announcement. For responding to individual members in the team group, if you don't know an answer, still explain your stance on the problem so that we know how everyone feels. If everyone feels as though they are stuck, we can consult outside help from Professor Nelson

# Problem Statement 

After graduating from college, computer science students often face a steep drop-off in structured support for navigating the job market. Without the institutional backing of college, such as career centers, faculty guidance, or peer networks, many find themselves isolated and uncertain about how to approach their job search. Throughout their academic career, there have been provided counselors, administrators, and even peers who were always readily available to answer questions to be had about the next phases of life, but as time under an institution ends, so does the assistance from counselors. The lack of accessible mentorship and reliable resources leaves graduates struggling to make informed decisions, build professional connections, and maintain momentum in their transition from academia to industry. How can we ensure that assistance is given to those in need, in a less temporary period of time?
