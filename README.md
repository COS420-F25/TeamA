Communications:

Discord Response: Typically 2 hours for a response unless on a tricky hour of the day - 
otherwise feel free to message on phone in the created text groupchat @everyone policy: 
Dont feel like you cant use it, but when you mention someone, make it a general announcement 
Response: If you dont know an answer, still explain your stance on the problem so that we know 
how everyone feels. If everyone feels as though they are stuck, we can consult outside help
