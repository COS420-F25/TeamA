# Communications:

Typically we ideally expect 2 hours for a response unless on a tricky hour of the day. otherwise feel free to message via phone in the created text groupchat on imessage. for our @everyone policy, dont feel like you cant use it, but when you mention someone, make it a general announcement. For responding to individual members in the team group, if you dont know an answer, still explain your stance on the problem so that we know how everyone feels. If everyone feels as though they are stuck, we can consult outside help from Professor Nelson

# Problem Statement 1
Students often lack confidence in having the necessary skills for the current job market. For example, many students are reported to have imposter syndrome despite their current levels of skills. Standard solutions like traditional education focus on teaching a wide range of skills in computer science. Due to limited time and resources these topics are tackled at a surface level. The problem is many job postings require deep knowledge in certain specialized areas. This creates a gap between students who have a broad knowledge base and jobs that require deep knowledge of specialized topics. How can we create a way for students to gain confidence in their skillset and to showcase their abilities? 



# Problem Statement 2
After graduating from college, computer science students often face a steep drop-off in structured support for navigating the job market. Without the institutional backing of college, such as career centers, faculty guidance, or peer networks, many find themselves isolated and uncertain about how to approach their job search. Throughout their academic career, there have been provided counselors, administrators, and even peers who were always readily available to answer questions to be had about the next phases of life, but as time under an institution ends, so does the assistance from counselors. The lack of accessible mentorship and reliable resources leaves graduates struggling to make informed decisions, build professional connections, and maintain momentum in their transition from academia to industry. How can we ensure that assistance is given to those in need, in a less temporary period of time?
